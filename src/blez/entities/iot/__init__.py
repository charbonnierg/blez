"""IoT Hub Python API

This module defines the following classes:

- DeviceBackend: An abstract class which defines expected methods for device implementation. Usually, each protocol has an associated backend (BLE, OPCUA, ...)
- StationBackend: An abstract class which defines expected methds for station implementation. Usually, each protocol has an associated backend (BLE, OPCUA, ...)
- Gateway: A service which can be deployed on various locations to interact with IoT devices.
- IoT Hub: A service which must continously be up and running, and publicly available.
- IoT Client: Used by developers within their applications. Can be implemented in many languages.
- Remote Station: Used by developers within their applications. Can be implemented in many languages.
- Remote Device: Used by developers within their applications. Can be implemented in many languages.
